Block vs Inline Elements

Inline -> Think of people in a line and the element we place is "In line". Takes space up space vertically
Block -> Stacked like blocks and the element is "a block". Takes up space horizontally

Div should be used to group elements together, CSS will shape and design the contents : BLOCK ELEMENT
Span can use to wrap certain text inside of a <p>, great to style things : INLINE ELEMENT


Horizontal Break  = <hr>
Line break = <br>
Super script  = <sup> 
Sub script  = <sub>

--------------------------------------------------------------------

HTML Entities
Start with & and end with ;
Characters that arent easy to type on a keyboard

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Semantic Markup

naming and using names that pertain to the info that inside of them
Crawling pages with poor semantic markup makes it astronomically harder

Other names for <div> are 
<section>
<article>
<nav>
<main> -> should only have content pertaining to the page (no side bars, navbar)
<header>
<footer>
<aside>
<summary>
<details>
