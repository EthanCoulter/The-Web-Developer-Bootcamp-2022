    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild
        species such as
        the grey and the Ceylon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_junglefowl">junglefowl[1]</a> that are
        originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term
        for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon.
        An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature
        female is called a pullet. Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and
        eggs) and as pets. Traditionally they
        were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places.
        Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as
        of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.
        There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickens â€“
        in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.

    <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
        Asia,[3]
        but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent.
        From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in Egypt in the mid-15th
        century BC, with
        the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according
        to the annals of Thutmose III.
        [4][5][6] They are known in Greece from the 5th century BC.[7][8]
        In 2011 a study in genetic and archaeological[9] evidence conclude that the origin of the modern-day chicken is
        from Southeast Asia.</p>
